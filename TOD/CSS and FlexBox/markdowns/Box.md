### The Box Model
A crucial concept in CSS is the **box model**. Every element on a webpage is a rectangular box, with boxes sometimes nested within each other or positioned side-by-side. To get a quick visual of these boxes on any webpage, add an outline to each element by using the following CSS:

```css
* {
  outline: 2px solid red;
}
