## Inspecting HTML and CSS
### The Inspector
To access the inspector, right-click any webpage element and select “Inspect” or press **F12**. Once you’re in Dev Tools, focus on the **Elements** and **Styles** panels.

### Inspecting Elements
The **Elements** panel displays the HTML structure of your page. You can:
1. Click any element within the panel to select it.
2. Use the **highlighted blue icon** (top-left in Dev Tools) to hover over and select elements on the page directly.

Once selected, the **Styles** tab shows all the styles applied to that element. Styles that are overridden by other rules appear with a strikethrough. For example, selecting the main header on a homepage will reveal all its active and overridden styles on the right.

### Testing Styles in the Inspector
The **Styles** panel allows you to test styles directly in the browser. You can:
- Click within a selector to add a new rule.
- Modify existing attributes and values, with changes reflected on the page in real-time.

These adjustments only affect the live browser session, not the actual source code, which makes the inspector perfect for quick experimentation without editing files or refreshing the page.
